### simple backend project with support for role-based security and a maching Pure JavaScript frontend

## IMPORTANT BEFORE YOU START

### This repo contains two projects
- A Java/Spring-boot based REST backend
- A matching plain JavaScript frontend

After cloning the project DO NOT OPEN it via the root folder, but open EACH PART (front and back) from your preferred IDE(s) via the respective root folders for these projects.

Failing to do this could cost you a LOT OF PROBLEMS!!


## IMPORTANT IF YOU PLAN TO USE THIS AS START-CODE FOR A FUTURE PROJECT

Delete the .git folder in the root, and do a git init in both the backend folder and frontend folder and create TWO projects on GitHub for the two.
